### Disassembler
## Objective:
- The goal of this project is to write a program that can open and read in a .OBJ file created by PennSim, parse it, and load it into a linked list that will represent the LC4’s program and data memories (similar to what PennSim’s “loader” does). 
- We will be able to read in a .OBJ file and convert it back to the assembly it came from! 
- This is known as reverse Assembling (sometimes a disassembler).
